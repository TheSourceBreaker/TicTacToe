Setup:

At the start choose the Board Size and Player to begin with.
When choosing a Board Size, input the first number of the size.
Ex: (3) == (3x3)

To play this, type in the number of any slot you wish to choose.
Ex: [][][]       [1][][]
    [][][] + 1 = [][][]
    [][][]	 [][][]

Player 1's Mark is "1" instead of "X", while Player 2's Mark is "2" instead of "O".

Whoever gets three in a row, in any fashion, wins.
